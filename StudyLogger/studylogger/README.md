# StudyLogger
This tool was mainly used by the research to log events while observing participants. It was custom made to only contain relevant buttons so the researchers could log events timely and without distraction.

## Setup
- At least node version 20 installed on the system.
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Go to the url shown by vite in the terminal (usualy http://localhost:5173).

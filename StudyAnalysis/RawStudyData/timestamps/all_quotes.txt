Irgendwas stimmt nicht, ich weiß noch nicht was
standard abweichung ist "off" im posterior (passt nicht zum prior)
gefühlt schaut es besser aus
Ad Reparemeterise: das ist ja cool. Wenn er das sagt, probiern wir das aus
Ok, I don't really know whats going on
Something is happening, that is very good. The debugger is useful
I will need more time to findout more about the numbers
Maybe the problem is in the model but I couldn't find anything problematic there
it actually tells you what to do and I think it works now
maybe setting adapt_step_size to true would be even better
If i had time I would increase more
I try to fix the acceptance rate but i dont know
It is nice to have the graph visualized on the side
it is nice to see how the chain developes
I totally see that something is wrong, but I can't really say what.
I like that I also see the trace of the tuning step. This is something I don't see in PYMC
I still have no idea what this model is
I am a little lost
I have no idea what to expect
It's actually really nice to see it happening
I dont know pymc that well but with stan you have to write 2-3 different models for one thing 
Maybe its dangerous to have something like this, because the debugger looks great but then you forget to actually check your model predictions
tau quadriert könnte kritisch sein
HalfCauchy might be problematic. How could I findout if this creates a problem?
It is hard to see for me what is wanted in the model.
It looks very abstract
The debugger is very cool in my opinion
It's very helpful to get direct feedback
It's a bit like tensorboard. very comfortable
I am unsure how to interprete the black areas in the plot
The tool doesn't show me any issues but the graph looked weird
The usual things I do don't work so well in vscode in the browser
This should be ok
I cant interprete rhat so thats it from me, very usefull information though
solved something oO but correct?? CHECK

# Notebooks
The two notebooks are pre executed with all results preserved and contain the code that was used for data analysis in the study. If you want to reproduce the results you can follow the installation instructions in the next section and then run the notebooks yourself. 

## System requirements to run the code in the Notebooks

## With conda
- Run `conda create -n "inferlog" -c conda-forge python=3.10`
